# Rock Paper Scissors ✊✋✌️

A classic Rock Paper Scissors game built in **two stages** as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) Foundations curriculum:

1. **Console Version** – Play in the browser console using prompts and logs.
2. **DOM Version** – Fully interactive interface using buttons, real-time score updates, and result display.

This project showcases the use of **JavaScript logic**, **DOM manipulation**, and **basic UI design**.
